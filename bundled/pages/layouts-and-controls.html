<p>What are layouts, what are controls?</p>

<h3 class="sample-section-title">Controls</h3>
<p>
  All of smallest components on screen that can be standalone, they will receive
  input and emit the output, such as: button, slider, progressbar, loading
  indicator, inputs, tabs...
</p>
<p style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
  <img class="doc-sample-image" src="./assets/images/controls.svg" />
</p>

<h3 class="sample-section-title">Layouts</h3>
<p>
  When we have all of the controls but where to put them on? How controls
  display on screen follow the UI design or how can we arrange them to complete
  the screen?<br />
  To define where to place the controls, we will need to have common layout
  components as well. However, most of client teams when they install and reuse
  our package, they will have to build their own new layouts system to follow
  the design system. Which will makes inconsistency between our projects.

<p>
  Layouts are sidebar, header, section, container, group of controls like a
  input group.

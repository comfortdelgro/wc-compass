# WC Compass

This project provides a set of components for the Web Component Compass Design System that can be used to
implement user experiences consistent with
[ComfortDelGro's design principles](https://comfortdelgro.github.io/compass-design).

## Getting started

To use this library in your project, you can install it via NPM using the following command:

```sh
yarn add @comfortdelgro/wc-compass

or

```sh
npm install @comfortdelgro/wc-compass
```

or

```sh

## Development

To contribute to this library or modify it for your own purposes, you can clone this repository and install the required dependencies using NPM or Yarn:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/comfortdelgro/wc-compass.git
cd wc-compass
npm install
```
or

```sh
git clone https://github.com/comfortdelgro/wc-compass.git
cd wc-compass
pnpm install 
```

**Once you've installed the dependencies, you can start the development server and preview the components by running the following command:**

run with document phase

```sh
git clone https://github.com/comfortdelgro/wc-compass.git
cd wc-compass
pnpm run build
pnpm run dev 
```

with development phase

```sh
git clone https://github.com/comfortdelgro/wc-compass.git
cd wc-compass
cd packages
cd wc-compass
pnpm run build 
pnpm run dev
```
This will start a development server at http://localhost:8080/ and open a preview of the components in your browser. You can modify the components in the src directory and the preview will automatically update.
